  "summary": "The diff adds documentation describing a frontend build/root-cause and introduces local frontend utilities/primitives to resolve missing imports. It also adds a smoke-test checklist and a client-side smoke check utility. However, the diff does not contain evidence that the failing production deployment was actually reproduced/run successfully, nor that a live post-deploy smoke test was performed. There are also backend/auth/admin-related changes that appear unrelated to fixing the deployment failure.",

      "requirement": "Reproduce the production/live deployment failure and capture the exact failing step and error output, then apply minimal changes so the same production/live deployment command completes successfully.",
      "reason": "The diff includes a narrative root-cause document and code changes aimed at fixing build/import issues, but it does not include the actual failing command output/logs or any evidence that the same production deployment process was re-run and now succeeds (e.g., CI logs, deploy script output, or recorded error output).",

      "requirement": "Perform a post-deploy smoke test of the live site (homepage loads, header/footer render, Contact links present; no critical above-the-fold asset 404s).",
      "reason": "The diff adds a manual checklist and an optional automated smoke-check utility, but there is no evidence in the diff that the smoke test was actually executed against the live URL or that results were recorded/verified.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest is narrowly focused on fixing a deployment error and validating the live marketing site; the diff shows substantial backend access-control and profile endpoints that are not evidenced as necessary to resolve the deployment failure in the provided root-cause writeup (which discusses frontend build/import issues).",

      "description": "Admin inbox/protected admin page and related inquiry/admin hooks described as part of the change set.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest non-goals disallow adding new unrelated product features; the diff summary indicates an admin inbox feature set (protected admin page, inquiry list/detail, delete) that appears unrelated to resolving a deployment failure for the marketing site.",
